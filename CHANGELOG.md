* Included safe blur dependency ([a36d003](https://https///github.com/haztivity/jq-snap-puzzle/commits/a36d003))
* Pieces array will preserve the order. ([cf78094](https://https///github.com/haztivity/jq-snap-puzzle/commits/cf78094))
* When the pieces are programmatically solved, the piece that is resolving could be animated behind the pieces already placed due to an incorrect zIndex management ([dcbdd84](https://https///github.com/haztivity/jq-snap-puzzle/commits/dcbdd84))
